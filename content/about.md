First of all, hello and welcome. This is my site, just a corner of the internet I call mine. A quiet cabin in the vast woods of the wild forest that the internet should be. I'll assume you read the front page or if you didn't, you can click on the top left to go there. This spot is more for opinion-style content so I can document my outlook on things n' stuff.
