First of all, hello and welcome. This is my site, just a corner of the internet I call mine.
My little cabin in the vast woods of the internet.

- Kubernetes (self-deployed and self-managed clusters, upstream k8s as well as k3s)
- Ansible and Terraform for automation
- Proxmox and libvirt for virtualization
- pfSense for routing at home
