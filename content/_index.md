This is my personal site, mostly written by myself and for myself.

## Skills
- Go, Java, SQL, Bash and other languages
- Docker (deployment, development, debugging and more)

- Ansible and Terraform for automation
- Proxmox and libvirt for virtualization
- pfSense and OPNSense for routing at home
- TrueNAS and ZFS for storage
- Packaging for Gentoo Linux using ebuilds
