First of all, hello and welcome. This is my site, just a corner of the internet I call mine.
A quiet cabin in the vast woods of the wild forest that the internet should be.
I'll assume you read the front page or if you didn't, you can click [here]({{< ref "/" >}}) to reach it.

## Skills
- Go, Bash and other languages
- Docker (deployment, development, debugging and more)
- Kubernetes (self-deployed and managed clusters, upstream k8s as well as k3s)
- Ansible and Terraform for automation
- Proxmox
- Packaging for Gentoo Linux using ebuilds

## Highlighted Projects
- I'm sure I'll think of something

## Reach Me
- through the [contact page]({{< ref "contact" >}})
