## Travelling backwards
I've been looking at java again lately.
In small time gaps between online classes I've been watching tutorials about it again.
It's as complicated as I remember it but not terrible to work with.
The annotations are not the best ergonomically, I have to admit, since they're not as well supported as actual code.
The internal wiring and complexity as well as some oddball issues with running tests that came up surprised me but I guess it's a matter of getting used to it.
Not only that, there are other backend technologies in the Java that I find interesting.
It might appear antequated but JSP is actually pretty fun to use.
