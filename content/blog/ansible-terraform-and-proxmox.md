## Intro
In the continuing quest to improve my homelab I've written a few ansible playbooks as well as terraform configuration to automate a lot of tasks.
The initial setup of proxmox is handled by ansible, the provisioning of virtual machines is handled by terraform and the installation of k3s on the VMs is done by ansible.

## Proxmox Setup with Ansible

### Host

### Template VM


## Terraform Setup

### Provider

### Basic `main.tf`


## Real-World Example with k3s
